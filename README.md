# Hang Man Node Application 

This is a word guessing game application built in Node.js. The goal is to guess the word one letter at a time. The theme for this game is Greek Mythology characters, so this will test your familiarity with Greek Mythology.

Here are the rules for this game : 
* the round starts by displaying a word that is hidden - each letter is replaced by an underscore
* guess the word one letter at a time by keying in letters of the alphabet using your keyboard
* per round you are given 10 total guesses to solve the word
* guessing a wrong letter decreases your number of guesses left by 1
* the game will not allow you to use the same letter twice, so it will display an error but it will not decrease your number of guesses left
* guessing the correct letter shows the letter in it's correct position, replacing the undescore carracter with the actual letter you have chosen
* if you guessed the word successfully, you will move on to the next round and will be given a new word to guess
* if your guesses left goes to 0 and still haven't solved the word, you will be given a choice to continue playing or end the game
* there will be a total of 20 rounds in this game. The game will end when you run out of words to guess - if you get this far :)

##Good Luck and enjoy the game!!!
